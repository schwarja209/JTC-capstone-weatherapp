## ADR-001: Layered Architecture Pattern

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: Need to organize a complex weather application with GUI, business logic, data management, and external API integration.

**Decision**: Implement a layered architecture with clear separation:
- `utils/` - Common utilities and helpers
- `services/` - External integrations and API clients  
- `core/` - Business logic and data management
- `gui/` - User interface coordination
- `widgets/` - Specialized UI components
- `features/` - Cross-cutting functionality

**Rationale**: 
- Clear separation of concerns
- Testable business logic isolated from UI
- Easy to modify layers independently
- Standard pattern for complex applications
- Excellent foundation for theme-based features

**Alternatives**: 
- Monolithic structure with mixed concerns
- MVC pattern with strict model/view/controller separation
- Component-based architecture

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Easy to test business logic separately

- ❌ Requires careful design to avoid tight coupling
- ❌ Central state object can become large

---

## ADR-003: Mixed State Access Patterns

**Status**: Superseded by ADR-029

**Context**: GUI components need different types of state access - direct binding for widgets vs. encapsulated access for business logic.

**Decision**: Use mixed state access patterns:
- Direct tkinter variable access (`self.state.city.get()`) for UI widget binding
- Method access (`self.state.get_current_city()`) for business logic operations

**Rationale**:
- UI widgets require direct tkinter variable binding for reactivity
- Business logic benefits from encapsulated, validated access
- Each pattern serves its use case optimally

**Alternatives**:
- Always use direct access (less encapsulation)
- Always use methods (verbose for UI binding)
- Create separate state objects for UI vs. business logic

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Optimal approach for each use case
- ✅ Maintains tkinter's reactive binding capabilities

**Clarification**
This ADR specifically targets derived mapping functions and computed constants that duplicate information already available through direct configuration access. It does NOT apply to architectural design data structures that serve legitimate organizational purposes.

**Scope of ADR-026**:
- ✅ REMOVED: Functional mappings like `get_key_to_display_mapping()`, `get_display_to_key_mapping()`
- ✅ REMOVED: Computed constants like `KEY_TO_DISPLAY`, `DISPLAY_TO_KEY`, `DEFAULT_VISIBILITY`
- ✅ REPLACED: Direct access patterns like `config.METRICS[key]['label']`

**Outside Scope of ADR-026**:
- ❌ RETAINED: `ENHANCED_DISPLAY_LABELS` - Design feature for enhanced metric display formatting
- ❌ RETAINED: `METRIC_GROUPS` - UI organization structure for widget layout and grouping
- ❌ RETAINED: Other architectural data structures that serve design purposes beyond simple mapping

**Rationale for Retention**:
`ENHANCED_DISPLAY_LABELS` and `METRIC_GROUPS` are not simple derived mappings but rather design-driven data structures that:

1. Serve specific UI/UX requirements for enhanced display formatting
2. Provide logical organization for complex widget layouts
3. Support future development features and satirical enhancement functionality
4. Cannot be replaced by simple direct access to base `METRICS` configuration

## ADR-031: Comprehensive Weather Feature Implementation

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: Weather application needed professional-grade weather features beyond basic temperature and humidity.

**Decision**: Implement comprehensive weather feature set:
- **Derived Comfort Metrics**: Heat index, wind chill, dew point using official NWS formulas
- **Weather Comfort Score**: Composite 0-100 rating with visual progress bar
- **Enhanced Alert System**: Three-tier severity system (watch/caution/warning) with visual indicators
- **Color-Coded Metrics**: Dynamic color coding based on weather conditions and comfort ranges
- **Extended Weather Data**: Wind direction/gusts, precipitation details, visibility, atmospheric conditions
- **Professional Data Processing**: Comprehensive unit conversion, data validation, error handling

**Rationale**:
- Professional weather applications require comprehensive data
- Derived metrics provide better user decision-making information
- Visual indicators improve user experience significantly
- Complete weather data set enables advanced features
- Professional foundation ready for satirical enhancement

**Alternatives**:
- Basic weather data only (temperature, humidity, conditions)
- Gradual feature addition over time
- Focus on UI over data completeness

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Professional-grade weather application
- ✅ Comprehensive weather data ready for any interpretation
- ✅ Excellent foundation for satirical weather manipulation
- ✅ User experience matches commercial weather applications
- ✅ Complete feature set eliminates need for future data additions
- ❌ More complex data processing and validation required
- ❌ Larger codebase to maintain

## ADR-032: Satirical Enhancement Foundation

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: Application architecture needed to support dual-theme satirical weather interpretation without compromising core functionality.

**Decision**: Build satirical enhancement foundation into core architecture:
- **Theme-Aware Error Handler**: Complete with optimistic/pessimistic/neutral message templates
- **Modular Widget System**: Widget architecture ready for theme-specific UI variations
- **Comprehensive Weather Data**: Complete weather interpretation infrastructure ready for filtering
- **Color Manipulation System**: Dynamic color coding ready for theme-based distortion
- **Alert System Foundation**: Comprehensive alert infrastructure ready for satirical interpretation
- **Configuration-Driven Design**: Easy addition of theme-specific behaviors and settings

**Rationale**:
- Theme system integration requires architectural planning from the beginning
- Weather interpretation foundation must be solid before adding satirical layers
- Error handling system needs theme awareness built-in
- UI architecture must support dynamic behavior changes
- Complete weather data enables rich satirical interpretation possibilities

**Alternatives**:
- Add theme system as separate overlay later
- Focus on core functionality first, satirical features second
- Implement themes as configuration-only changes

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Architecture ready for satirical enhancement without major refactoring
- ✅ Theme-aware error handling already implemented
- ✅ Complete weather data ready for interpretation manipulation
- ✅ UI system designed for dynamic theme-based changes
- ✅ Professional foundation maintains core functionality regardless of theme
- ❌ More complex initial architecture
- ❌ Some infrastructure overhead for features not yet implemented

## ADR-033: GUI-Coupled State Management

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: Application state management needed to support reactive GUI updates while maintaining simple, maintainable code for a desktop tkinter application.

**Decision**: Implement state management with direct tkinter variable coupling rather than decoupled observer patterns.

**Rationale**:
- Direct widget binding enables reactive UI: `ttk.Entry(textvariable=self.state.city)`
- Automatic UI updates when state changes without manual event handling
- Simple, maintainable code suitable for desktop GUI application
- Eliminates need for complex observer/pub-sub patterns for UI synchronization
- Pragmatic approach for single-platform tkinter application

**Alternatives**:
- Decoupled state management with observer pattern (added complexity)
- Separate GUI state and business state objects (data synchronization overhead)
- Manual UI update methods (prone to inconsistency and bugs)

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Simple, direct widget binding and automatic UI updates
- ✅ Maintainable code without complex event handling
- ✅ No synchronization bugs between state and UI
- ✅ Excellent developer experience for GUI development
- ❌ State manager requires GUI context (impacts testability)
- ❌ Cannot reuse state management in headless scenarios
- ❌ Tests require tkinter root window setup

**Testing Impact**: Tests must initialize tkinter context but this is acceptable trade-off for desktop application simplicity.

## ADR-034: Direct Configuration Access Pattern

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: Application components need access to configuration data including metrics definitions, alert thresholds, chart settings, and API configuration across multiple modules.

**Decision**: Use direct configuration access (`config.METRICS`, `config.ALERT_THRESHOLDS`, etc.) throughout the application rather than implementing configuration management abstraction layers.

**Rationale**:
- Configuration is immutable after application startup
- No runtime configuration changes required for weather dashboard functionality
- Direct access provides simple, performant lookups
- Centralized validation at startup (`config.validate_config()`) catches errors early
- Easy to test with mock patches of config module
- Eliminates unnecessary abstraction overhead for static configuration

**Alternatives**:
- Configuration manager class with getter methods (unnecessary abstraction)
- Dependency injection of config objects (added complexity without benefit)
- Configuration caching system (premature optimization for static data)
- Runtime configuration change notification system (not required)

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Simple, direct configuration access throughout application
- ✅ No performance overhead from abstraction layers
- ✅ Easy to understand and maintain configuration usage
- ✅ Centralized validation ensures configuration integrity at startup
- ✅ Straightforward testing with configuration patches
- ❌ No runtime configuration change capability (not needed)
- ❌ No access control per configuration section (not required)
- ❌ Modules directly coupled to config structure (acceptable trade-off)

**Usage Examples**: `config.METRICS[key]['label']`, `config.ALERT_THRESHOLDS['temperature_high']`, `config.CHART["range_options"]`

**Validation**: All configuration validated once at startup via `config.validate_config()` in main.py.
