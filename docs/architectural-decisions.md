## ADR-001: Layered Architecture Pattern

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: Need to organize a complex weather application with GUI, business logic, data management, and external API integration.

**Decision**: Implement a layered architecture with clear separation:
- `utils/` - Common utilities and helpers
- `services/` - External integrations and API clients  
- `core/` - Business logic and data management
- `gui/` - User interface coordination
- `widgets/` - Specialized UI components
- `features/` - Cross-cutting functionality

**Rationale**: 
- Clear separation of concerns
- Testable business logic isolated from UI
- Easy to modify layers independently
- Standard pattern for complex applications

**Alternatives**: 
- Monolithic structure with mixed concerns
- MVC pattern with strict model/view/controller separation
- Component-based architecture

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Easy to test business logic separately
- ✅ Clear import dependencies prevent circular references
- ✅ New developers can understand structure quickly
- ❌ More files and directories to navigate
- ❌ Some overhead for simple operations

---

## ADR-002: Centralized State Management

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: GUI applications need coordinated state management across multiple widgets and components.

**Decision**: Implement centralized state management with `WeatherDashboardState` class replacing distributed `gui_vars` dictionary approach.

**Rationale**:
- Single source of truth for application state
- Type-safe state access with validation
- Easier debugging and state inspection
- Supports complex state operations and cleanup

**Alternatives**:
- Keep distributed `gui_vars` dictionary approach
- Individual widget state management
- Observer pattern with state notifications

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Easier to track and debug state changes
- ✅ Type safety and validation built-in
- ✅ Cleaner interfaces for state access
- ❌ Requires careful design to avoid tight coupling
- ❌ Central state object can become large

---

## ADR-003: Mixed State Access Patterns

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: GUI components need different types of state access - direct binding for widgets vs. encapsulated access for business logic.

**Decision**: Use mixed state access patterns:
- Direct tkinter variable access (`self.state.city.get()`) for UI widget binding
- Method access (`self.state.get_current_city()`) for business logic operations

**Rationale**:
- UI widgets require direct tkinter variable binding for reactivity
- Business logic benefits from encapsulated, validated access
- Each pattern serves its use case optimally

**Alternatives**:
- Always use direct access (less encapsulation)
- Always use methods (verbose for UI binding)
- Create separate state objects for UI vs. business logic

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Optimal approach for each use case
- ✅ Maintains tkinter's reactive binding capabilities
- ✅ Business logic remains clean and testable
- ❌ Two patterns to understand and maintain
- ❌ Need to ensure correct pattern usage

## ADR-004: Service Boundary Exception Conversion

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: Need consistent error handling across application layers while maintaining flexibility for different error types.

**Decision**: Convert all utility exceptions to custom exceptions at service boundaries:
- Utilities raise standard Python exceptions (`ValueError`, etc.)
- Services convert to custom exceptions (`ValidationError`, `NetworkError`, etc.)
- Controllers handle only custom exceptions

**Rationale**:
- Clear architectural responsibility (services own conversion)
- Controllers have consistent exception handling
- Custom exceptions provide better context and theming support
- Utilities remain simple and reusable

**Alternatives**:
- All layers use standard exceptions
- All layers use custom exceptions
- Controllers handle conversion

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns
- ✅ Theme-aware error messaging support
- ✅ Consistent controller error handling
- ❌ Service methods need try/catch blocks
- ❌ Some double-wrapping of exceptions
