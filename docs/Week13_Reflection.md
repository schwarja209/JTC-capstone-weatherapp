# Week 13 Reflection ‚Äì Capstone Progress

## Overview
At this point in the project, I've completed most of the foundational structure for my Dual-Theme Weather App. While many core modules are fully functional, some of the major "mode-specific" and "satirical" features (Theme Switcher, Tomorrow‚Äôs Guess, and Weather History Tracker) remain as scaffolds. That said, I've made significant progress on modularization, UI layout, data management, and testing infrastructure.

## What I‚Äôve Accomplished

### Milestones
- **Full project modularization** into logical components:
  - `/features/` for theme and behavior modules, added `/alerts/`
  - `/widgets/` split by component type (charts, metrics, tabs, etc.)
  - `/services/`, `/utils/`, `/tests/`, and `/gui/` structure solidified
- **Functional weather dashboard** with:
  - Real-time weather API integration
  - Simulated fallback data via `SampleWeatherGenerator`
  - Interactive UI with selectable metrics, derived metrics, unit conversion, status monitoring, and chart rendering
  - Color coded metrics based on live weather data
- **Dynamic metric toggling**, including Select All and Clear All buttons, and live-updating chart selection based on user input
- **Logging, error handling, and fallback detection** cleanly separated and implemented
- **Robust test suite** with unit tests across `data_manager`, `state_manager`, `unit_converter`, and more

## What I‚Äôm Still Working On

### üõ†Ô∏è **Incomplete or Placeholder Features**
- **Theme Switcher**: The file and base logic exist (`theme_switcher.py`), but the actual switching behavior and theme application are not implemented.
- **Tomorrow‚Äôs Guess**: `tomorrows_guess.py` is a stub. Still need to build the logic for tone-adjusted forecast guessing based on trends and mode.'
- **Weather History Tracker**: The structural placeholder exists, but I'm reconsidering his feature in favor of the alert system, based on api data limitations.
- **Badge System**: No current logic for triggering, displaying, or tracking badges, though the design vision is somewhat reflected by alert system and comfort bar.

## What I‚Äôve Learned

- Building a highly modular Tkinter app is challenging but rewarding
- Separating logic into service, widget, and controller layers gives better control over feature growth, but maintaining good documentation and avoiding repeated or overly complicated and clean code has been tough.
- Mocking or scaffolding unfinished modules is very valuable for integration planning, even before full functionality is developed.

## What I Plan To Do Next

### üéØ **Week 14 Goals**
- Implement working **Theme Switcher** (UI callbacks, styling hooks, mode persistence across frames)
- Develop logic for **Tomorrow‚Äôs Guess**, using simulated trend patterns and exaggerated mode tone
- Start drafting **badge trigger conditions** and UI popup integration

## API Integration Details

"I've implemented real-time weather API integration using OpenWeatherMap's current weather endpoint. The API key is securely loaded from environment variables using `dotenv`, with all requests routed through a centralized `WeatherAPIService` class that includes rate limiting. When API calls fail or cities are invalid, the app gracefully falls back to simulated data via `SampleWeatherGenerator`. Error handling is cleanly separated into dedicated modules. The architecture supports both metric and imperial unit systems with automatic conversion. The next major step is adapting this fetch logic to support dual-theme tone interpretation.

## UI Mockups and Interface

In this folder is a current screenshot of the live dashboard layout

The UI features a tabbed interface with Current Weather and Weather Trends tabs. The control panel includes city input, metric/imperial unit toggle, grouped metric visibility checkboxes, and chart configuration dropdowns. The main display uses a two-column layout with enhanced metrics (temperature with feels-like, wind with direction/gusts, weather icons). Weather alerts are shown via status indicators and popup dialogs. The chart dropdown dynamically updates based on visible metric selections. A three-section status bar shows system status, loading progress, and data source (live vs simulated). All displays include color-coded values and a visual comfort score progress bar.

The mockup serves as a foundation for future divergence based on active theme (Optimistic or Pessimistic).

## Summary

This week marked a strong turning point in structural readiness. My codebase is now modular, clean, and extensible. I also now have extensive metrics and derived metrics to work with, as well as centralized styling and customizability.  While key features tied to the "dual theme" concept are not yet implemented, the app‚Äôs foundation is solid. Next week will be focused on building the thematic features that give the app its unique character.
