==================================================
SLIDE 2: THE SATIRICAL CONCEPT
==================================================

TITLE: The Satirical Concept

LEFT COLUMN - Core Philosophy:
• Objective Data, Subjective Interpretation: Same weather data, dramatically different presentations
• UI Psychology Experiment: How interface design manipulates user perception
• Meta-Commentary: Satirizing optimistic vs pessimistic worldviews

RIGHT COLUMN - Dual Themes:
• "Weather Bliss" (Optimistic): "Refreshingly crisp air for enhanced mental clarity!"
• "Weather Realist" (Pessimistic): "Hypothermia risk zone with joint pain amplification"
• Neutral Mode: Standard weather presentation

==================================================
SLIDE 3: TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE
==================================================

TITLE: Technical Architecture

LEFT COLUMN - Project Scale & Quality:
• 80+ Modular Files: Professional architecture with clean separation
• 50+ Test Files: Comprehensive testing with sophisticated mocking
• Production Ready: No significant bugs found in comprehensive review
• Theme-Aware Infrastructure: Error handling and UI systems prepared

RIGHT COLUMN - Key Features:
• Live Weather Data: OpenWeatherMap API with intelligent fallback
• Derived Metrics: Heat index, wind chill, dew point (NWS formulas)
• Alert System: Three-tier severity with visual indicators
• Dynamic Themes: Live switching between neutral/optimistic/pessimistic

==================================================
SLIDE 4: AI-ENHANCED DEVELOPMENT
==================================================

TITLE: AI-Enhanced Development

LEFT COLUMN - AI Development Strategy:
• Heavy AI Integration: Leveraged ChatGPT, Claude, and Cursor throughout development
• Architecture Design: AI-assisted in creating layered architecture patterns
• Code Quality: AI tools helped maintain consistent error handling and documentation
• Testing Strategy: AI-generated comprehensive test cases and mocking scenarios

RIGHT COLUMN - AI Benefits Realized:
