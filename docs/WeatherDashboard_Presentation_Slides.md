## Slide 2: The Satirical Concept

### Core Philosophy
- **Objective Data, Subjective Interpretation**: Same weather data, dramatically different presentations
- **UI Psychology Experiment**: How interface design manipulates user perception  
- **Meta-Commentary**: Satirizing optimistic vs pessimistic worldviews

### Dual Themes
- **"Weather Bliss" (Optimistic)**: "Refreshingly crisp air for enhanced mental clarity!"
- **"Weather Realist" (Pessimistic)**: "Hypothermia risk zone with joint pain amplification"
- **Neutral Mode**: Standard weather presentation
