Weather Dashboard Application Launcher

Secure entry point for the Weather Dashboard application.
This launcher properly imports the main application without manipulating sys.path.

Usage:
    python run_dashboard.py
    
    or from project root:
    python -m WeatherDashboard.run_dashboard
    
    or if installed:
    weather-dashboard

Security Note:
    This launcher does not modify sys.path to avoid potential import hijacking
    vulnerabilities. Instead, it relies on proper Python package structure.
